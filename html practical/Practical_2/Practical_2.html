    <p>The University Grants Commission (UGC) has launched a scheme on skills development based higher education as part of college/university education, leading to setting up of Bachelor of Vocation Courses (B.Voc.) to serve multiple needs.</p>
    <p>Ramanujan College under the umbrella of DDU Kaushal Kendra, set up in collaboration with NSDC, offers two vocational courses vis-à-vis B.Voc. (Banking & Finance) and B.Voc. (Software Development).</p>
    <p>The B.Voc. (Software Development) course comes under the purview of IT/ITes sector which is governed by NASSCOM Sector Skill Council whereas the B.Voc (Banking & Finance) is taken care of by the BFSI Sector Skill Council.

The Bachelor of Vocation model will be accessible to a large number of students offering low cost and high quality education, that provides vocational skills development thereby providing opportunities to learners to move directly to the employment sector or move into higher education sector. The program and curriculum is designed in such a way so that the students can be educated and skilled manpower can be created.
